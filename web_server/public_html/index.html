        <h2>A Story of Focus and Strength: The Cow and the Tiger</h2>
        <p>One day, a young cow was grazing in the forest when it noticed a hungry tiger eyeing it from a distance. Knowing it stood no chance in a race, the cow resorted to its wits.</p>
        <p>It noticed a pile of fresh green grass nearby, much more than it could eat alone. The cow called out to the tiger, offering to share the meal if the tiger spared its life. Intrigued by the cow’s courage and generosity, the tiger agreed. They both sat down and enjoyed the grass together.</p>
        <p>After the meal, the tiger, feeling satisfied and grateful, decided to let the cow go. From that day on, the tiger thought twice before following its primal instincts, and the cow continued to roam the forest wisely, making more friends along the way.</p>
        <p>This story reminds us that sometimes, strength isn’t just physical power, but also the wisdom to find peaceful solutions in face of danger.</p>
